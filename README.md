# House Price Prediction - Data Preprocessing and Modeling

This repository contains the code for preprocessing the dataset and building a neural network model for predicting house prices. The dataset used is named "train.csv".

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

2. Download the dataset:

   Place the "train.csv" file in the project directory.

3. Run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocessing.py
```

This script handles data understanding, checking data types, handling null values, visualizing numerical and categorical features, handling outliers, and splitting the data.

4. Run the modeling script:

```bash
python modeling.py
```

This script builds a neural network model using TensorFlow, compiles the model, and trains it on the preprocessed data.

## Notebooks

- `House_Price_Prediction_EDA.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the house price prediction dataset.

## File Structure

- `preprocessing.py`: Script for data preprocessing.
- `modeling.py`: Script for building and training the neural network model.
- `House_Price_Prediction_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis.

## Results

The results of the preprocessing and modeling steps will be displayed during script execution. Additionally, visualizations such as histograms and box plots will be generated to provide insights into the dataset.
